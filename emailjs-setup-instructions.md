## ALTERNATIVE: Quick Test Solution

For immediate testing, I can set up a working test endpoint that will deliver emails to users immediately.

## YOUR CURRENT STATUS

✅ Email capture is working (stored locally)
✅ Content generation is working (survival guides created)
❌ Email delivery to users needs EmailJS setup (5 minutes)

The forms are functional - we just need the EmailJS bridge to deliver content to users.

Would you like me to:
1. Walk you through the EmailJS setup, or
2. Implement an alternative working email service right now?
